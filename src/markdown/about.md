  My name is Emil. I'm 20 years old and live in the town of Slagelse. I've
  finished high school this year (the summer of 2019) and will be taking a year
  or two of before university. I would describe myself as engaged, curious,
  responsible, and with a drive to learn. I spend my free time running,
  programming and playing Magic the Gathering (an awesome trading card game).



  My interest for programming was sparked during my time in high school and
  especially for web-development. React has occupied my attention since in the
  forms of (create-react-app)[https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app],
  (Gatsby)[https://www.gatsbyjs.org/] and (next.js)[https://nextjs.org/]. I've
  also dabbled in the realm of (node.js)[https://nodejs.org/en/] and NoSQL
  databases such as (mongoDB)[https://www.mongodb.com/].
